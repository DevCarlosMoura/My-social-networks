    <h2>Who i am ?</h2>
    <img src="EU.JPEG">
    <p>My name is <b>Carlos Eduardo Moura</b>, i have 23 years old and computer science course at UniAnchieta. I aim to become a great fullstack developer and one day more abroad. I am currently looking to study english because i know the importance of fluency in a developer's career. I don't have any familiarity or work experience with programming yet, but i'm dedicated and hard-working, so i adapt quickly and also learn. Talking about my hobbies, i like games, art exhibitions, animes, i love asian culture in general, i really hope to be able to visit there one day and maybe live there and believe it or not i love training and going to the gym.</p>
